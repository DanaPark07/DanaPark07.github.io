<art style="font-size:30px"> The James Webb space telescope captures stunning photographs of celestial bodies and phenomena that are invisible to the naked eye. To analyze the monochromatic images and data sent by cameras and spectroscopes, a three-step process is needed which involves colorizing the images, correcting them at an appropriate ratio, and analyzing the data to extract valuable insights. Overall, James Webb's photographs offer a fascinating glimpse into the mysteries of the universe, and the process of capturing these images is a remarkable feat of engineering and technology. The James Webb Space Telescope is an advanced astronomical observatory capable of capturing celestial images in near-infrared to mid-infrared range. It can process and transmit over 57.2 GB of data per day at an impressive speed of 28 megabits per second, sending its observation data through antennas located in California, Madrid, and Canberra. NASA receives the data in just 5 seconds, and the ground image processing software interprets the raw data and reveals the hidden celestial objects and cosmic events that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye. The telescope uses cameras with separate filters to capture the entire object being observed across different wavelength bands. The image processing device assigns the three primary colors of light to each wavelength band. The colors become more subdivided as the filter band gets closer. James Webb's near-infrared cameras have 29 filters, while the mid-infrared devices have 10 filters. The text explains the process of creating a color photograph by assigning colors to wavelengths in the visible light region based on their respective color. Green and blue are added for shorter wavelengths, while red is added for longer wavelengths. To create a single color photograph, data from multiple observation devices are combined, and it is essential to divide the colors appropriately to cover the entire spectrum of light captured by the telescope.  Finally, adjusting the color tone for a visually pleasing image will ultimately complete a colorful space photograph.</art>
