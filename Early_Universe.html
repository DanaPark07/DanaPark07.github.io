<art style="font-size:30px"> The universe was dark after the Big Bang. Particles combined to form ionized atoms of hydrogen and deuterium. These atoms attracted electrons turning them into neutral atoms. This process of particles pairing up is called "Recombination". Recombination occurred approximately 240,000 to 300,000 years after the Big Bang. Light was impeded by free electrons before recombination, but after that, the universe became transparent. The Cosmic Microwave Background is the earliest point we can look back to with any form of light. The cosmic dark ages followed this, and it ended with the formation of the first stars. The text discusses the formation of the first stars that were larger and brighter than the Sun and released energetic ultraviolet radiation. This era is known as "the epoch of reionization," which refers to the point when most of the neutral hydrogen was reionized by the increasing radiation from these stars. Reionization is important as it presents one of the few means by which we can study the earliest stars. The emergence of these first stars marks the end of the "Dark Ages" in cosmic history, and understanding these first sources is critical as they greatly influenced the formation of later objects such as galaxies. The first stars that exploded as supernovae could have collapsed to form black holes. These black holes grew and merged to become the huge black holes found at the centers of nearly all massive galaxies.</p>
