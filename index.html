	<h2 style="font-size:60px;">James Webb Space Telescope</h2>
	<br>
	<p style= "font-size:20px;">The James Webb Space Telescope is a space observatory designed primarily to study infrared astronomy.</p>
	<p style= "font-size:20px;">Its mission is to delve into the deepest corners of the universe and explore every stage of its evolution - from the earliest moments of the Big Bang to the formation of galaxies and stars, and even the potential for life on Earth-like planets. </p>
	<p style= "font-size:20px;">With its advanced technology and sensitive instruments, the telescope promises to unlock many mysteries of the cosmos and provide invaluable insights into our origins and place in the universe.</p>
	<p style= "font-size:20px;">The James Webb Space Telescope represents a major advancement in our ongoing efforts to explore the cosmos and gain insights into our origins.</p>

<p style= "font-size:30px; background-color: #F6FFB4;">Early Universe:</p>
	  <p style= "font-size:20px;">Equipped with infrared technology, this powerful telescope acts as a time machine, allowing us to peer back more than 13.5 billion years to witness the first stars and galaxies forming in the darkness of the ancient universe.</h4>
	<br>
	  <br>
<p style= "font-size:30px; background-color: #CBFFB4;"> Galaxies Over Time: </p>
	<p style= "font-size:20px;">The Webb telescope is equipped with unprecedented infrared sensitivity, which enables astronomers to compare the earliest and faintest galaxies with todayâ€™s giant spiral and elliptical galaxies. </p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
<p style= "font-size:30px; background-color: #B4FFEE;"> Star Lifecycle: </p>
	  <p style= "font-size:20px;">This helps us understand the formation of galaxies over billions of years. With its ability to see through giant opaque dust clouds, Webb can observe the birth of stars and planetary systems, which is not possible with visible light observatories like Hubble. </p>
	   <br>
	  <br>
<p style= "font-size:30px; background-color: #B4C9FF;"> Other worlds:  </p>
	  <p style= "font-size:20px;"> Webb is also providing us with valuable information about the atmospheres of exoplanets, which could help us identify the building blocks of life elsewhere in the universe. In addition to studying other planetary systems, Webb is also exploring objects within our solar system. </p>
