<art style="font-size:30px"> Galaxies are formed when dark matter merges and clumps together. Dark matter is an invisible form of matter whose total mass in the universe is roughly five times that of "normal" matter. The way dark matter "clumps" together is that small objects form first, and are drawn together to form larger ones. This build-up of large systems is accompanied by the formation of luminous stars from gas and dust. The interaction of stars and galaxies with the invisible dark matter produced the present-day galaxies, organized into what is known as the "Hubble Sequence of galaxies".</art>

<art style="font-size:30px"> Galaxies are still forming today through collisions and mergers. The Andromeda galaxy is headed towards the Milky Way for a possible collision billions of years from now. Galaxies existed about one billion years after the Big Bang and while most were smaller and more irregular than today, some were similar to those seen nearby now. </art>
